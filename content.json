As shown in Table 3, the prediction results differ significantly from the traditional ones at the heat transfer branch path in some local areas (shown in the red circle in the figure, where the MAE is larger). Further through the performance evaluation criteria analysis, compared with the traditional design results, the design results predicted by the deep learning model use less HTCM material (RE-V), but have better heat transfer performance (RE-meanT). In summary, the test results effectively verify that the deep surrogate model has high prediction accuracy, and at the same time, through a large number of scheme learning, it is possible to obtain better performance solutions for individual design problems, providing new inspiration for traditional design optimization.
